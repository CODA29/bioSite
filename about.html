Born in the vibrant city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Naod grew up surrounded by a rich cultural heritage that inspired his early love for music and painting. He attended Grapes High School, where he cultivated his curiosity and drive for success. In 2008, Naod took his academic ambitions to the next level by joining the University of Dire Dawa, where he completed his degree in Marketing Management. After graduating, Naod set his sights on broader horizons, moving to the United States to further his education. He earned a master’s degree in Business Administration, a milestone that marked a significant step in his professional journey. Along the way, Naod found love and married Betty, his partner and biggest supporter. Together, they welcomed their daughter, Agla, who brings endless joy and inspiration to their lives. Currently, Naod works for a private company while diligently pursuing his dream of opening his own restaurant. A passionate coffee enthusiast, he envisions creating a space that combines his love for Ethiopian traditions with modern culinary artistry. When he’s not working or planning his business, Naod enjoys listening to music, creating art, and spending quality time with his family.
